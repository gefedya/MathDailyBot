### Math Daily

This is a Telegram bot with a base of math problems with three different topics and a difficulty setting from 0 to 4 (very easy to insane).
You ask the bot to send a problem by clicking the **"Give task"** button.

The possible commands are:
1. Give task. Before recieving a task there is an option to choose the subject of the problem (Set theory, Logic and Combinatorics)
1. Give a hint (there is one hint for each problem)
2. Give a solution

It is made sure that you don't get the same probem twice.

## Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

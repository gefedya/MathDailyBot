### Math Daily

This is a Telegram bot with a base of math problems with three different topics and a difficulty setting from 0 to 4 (very easy to insane).
You ask a bot to send a problem by sending **"Give task"**.

The possible commands are:
1. Give task. Before recieving a task there is an option to choose the subject of the problem
1. Give a hint (there is one hint for each problem)
2. Give a solution

It is made sure that you don't get the same probem twice.

The problems are stored on the following [website](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv4p7fxkFKxyHHFv&inviteToken=16f009a7c85eb7ae8e36f3892837b3390a4351fec7bf32395b8a8134ecae44d7).
